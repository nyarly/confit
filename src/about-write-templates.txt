Sets up a directory to be used with the --templates option. Rather than write bespoke templates against a context without any guidance, it's frequently useful to be able to start from known-good defaults. Once you've used this sub-commmand to produce the a templates directory, you can edit the Tera template files there and use them by passing the directory to --templates. You can even create new templates in that directory and refer to them with the --format flag.
